**Story**
Once upon a time there was a boy named gopal with his mother in the outskirts of a forest.
Gopal's father died long ago so the mother and son had no one to support to.
But the people in the village near their house are very helpful.
Gopal's mother was a big devotee of lord krishna and hence she gave the name to her son gopal.
When gopal grew up his mother told him a lot of stories about krishna.
But when gopal started to think and wonder his mother decided to send him to school.
So she collected enough money to send him to school and prayed that nothing wil go wrong.
