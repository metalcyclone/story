Once upon a time there was a boy named gopal with his mother in the outskirts of a forest.
Gopal's father died long ago so the mother and son had no one to support to.
But the people in the village near their house are very helpful.
Gopal's mother was a big devotee of lord krishna and hence she gave the name to her son gopal.
When gopal grew up his mother told him a lot of stories about krishna
